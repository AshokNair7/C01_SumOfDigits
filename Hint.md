#### Exercise : Sum of digits of a given number
Using the conditional constructs, 
write a program to find the sum of the digits in a given number, 
which is calculated by adding every digit in the given number 

	for a given number 12345, the sum of the digits will be 15
	i.e., sumOfDigits = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
